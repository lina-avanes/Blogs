      <p1> <strong>What is a DDOS Attack?</strong>  <br> 
        DDoS stands for Distributed Denia-of-Service attack. It is a cyber attack with 
        the intend of disrupting the normal operations of the target server or network. </p1>

        <br>
        
        <p2><strong> How does a DDoS attack occur? </strong> <br>
        DDoS is made possible by flooding the target 
        with a constant flood of traffic. The heavy traffic  overwhelms the target system 
        and causes a disruption or denial of service to normal everyday traffic.  </p2>
        <br><br><br>

        <p3><strong>DDoS vs. DoS</strong><br>
          <u>Dos</u><br>
          DoS which stands for  Denial-of-service attack, is when an attacker uses only a single 
          computer to direct heavy traffic to a specific target. Normally, it is easier for a server 
          or a Network to stop a DoS attack since it is coming from a single point. As we can see in 
          the example below, a single attacker is trying to launch a DDoS attack against a Amazon web 
          server. If the attacker is successful, the server would crash and customers would no longer 
          be able to shop. However, as mentioned before, a DoS attack is much easier to control than a 
          DDoS attack.
