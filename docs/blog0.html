        <h1>Blog 0: DDOS Attack</h1>

      <p1> <strong>What is a DDOS Attack?</strong>  <br> 
        DDoS stands for Distributed Denia-of-Service attack. It is a cyber attack with 
        the intend of disrupting the normal operations of the target server or network. </p1>

        <br><br>
        
        <p2><strong> How does a DDoS attack occur? </strong> <br>
        DDoS is made possible by flooding the target 
        with a constant flood of traffic. The heavy traffic  overwhelms the target system 
        and causes a disruption or denial of service to normal everyday traffic.  </p2>
        <br><br><br>

        <p3><strong>DDoS vs. DoS</strong><br>
          <u>Dos</u><br>
          DoS which stands for  Denial-of-service attack, is when an attacker uses only a single 
          computer to direct heavy traffic to a specific target. Normally, it is easier for a server 
          or a Network to stop a DoS attack since it is coming from a single point. As we can see in 
          the example below, a single attacker is trying to launch a DoS attack against a Amazon web 
          server. If the attacker is successful, the server would crash and customers would no longer 
          be able to shop. However, as mentioned before, a DoS attack is much easier to control than a 
          DDoS attack.

        </p3> <br>
        
        <p4><u>DDoS</u> <br>
          TThe difference between DoS & DDoS is the number of attackers involved. Dos is when a single attacker, 
          attacks using a single computer and DDoS is when multiple attacking computers are involved. Now, instead 
          of an attack coming from a single source, the amazon web server in this case, has to deal with multiple 
          attacking sources. When this happens, the heavy traffic sent from the attackers will overwhelm the server 
          resources and it will cause it to crash. Amazon customers will now be denied access to services since the server 
          is occupied with a DDoS Attack. Because there are many attackers involved, a DDoS attack is 
          harder to control.

        <p5><strong> How does a attacker get other computers involved in a DDoS attack? </strong> <br>
          The simple answer is by using malicious software. The attacker will develop a malware program and distribute 
          it over the internet and put it on websites or email attachments. If a vulnerable computer gets to these 
          infected websites or opens the infected email attachments, the malware will be installed on their computer 
          without the owner knowing that his/her computer has been infected. So now their computer has been recruited 
          with other computers to take part in a DDoS attack. This army of computers is refereed to as the Botnet. 
          Now this botnet can be controlled by the attacker who is called the bot master.

        <p6><strong>How to prevent against a DDoS attack? </strong><br>
          You can configure your network hardware against DDoS attacks, deploy anit-DDoS hardware and software 
          modules, and deploy a DDoS protection appliance. <br><br>
